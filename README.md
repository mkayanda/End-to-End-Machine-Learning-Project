# End-to-End-Machine-Learning-Project

This is my try at the California Housing Prices dataset as outlined in [Hands-on Machine Learning Book](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/).

## The Problem:

Is it worth investing in a given area or not? 

## Goal of the project

Build a predictive model of a district's median housing price given the attributes in the dataset.

Find the best predictive model (ML algorithms)
